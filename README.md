I have no sponsors.

This addition gives the support for Rad Studio Delphi 2007 to SqlitePass and quite possible to Delphi 2005, 2006.

Packages for Delphi 2007 would probably work in Delphi 2005, 2006.

## What is to be done?

Create subdirectory "Delphi2007" in the directory "Packages\Delphi" of the original SqlitePass and copy my files there.

Place the changed file SqlitePassDbo.inc to the "Sources" directory. Copy of this file is also in the "Sources" folder.

Compile Compile Runtime package and Compile and install Designtime package.

That is all, futher use usual procedure, as author of SqlitePass Luc DAVID describes in documentation ...
